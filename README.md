# README for Data Science Internship Repository

## Overview
Welcome to my GitHub repository! I am currently a **Data Science Intern** at **Oasis Infobyte**, and this repository serves as a collection of all the projects and tasks I have completed during my internship. Here, you will find various data science projects that demonstrate my skills and learning throughout this experience.

## Internship Details
- **Internship Duration**: One month (March - April 2024)
- **Company**: Oasis Infobyte
- **Role**: Data Science Intern

## Projects Included
This repository contains the following key projects:

### 1. Car Price Prediction
- **Description**: A predictive model that estimates car prices based on various features such as make, model, year, mileage, and more.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
- **Key Features**:
  - Data preprocessing and cleaning
  - Feature selection and engineering
  - Model training using regression algorithms
  - Evaluation of model performance using metrics like RMSE and RÂ²
